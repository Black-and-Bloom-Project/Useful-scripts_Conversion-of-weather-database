Version of this script: v05 (focused on S6 2016) (last update: 27/10/2020)
Author: Nuno Canha

# Goal of the script:
This script aims to convert the original dataset in a dataset with selected parameters (eg., temperature, relative humidity, wind speed and wind direction) in order to compare with other databases. This script uses as an example the S6 weather data for the year of 2016.

The output of this script is a csv file with 1hour averaged values for a specific time period (monitoring period in 2016 for the B&B campaign), along with time-series' Figures of selected parameters.
